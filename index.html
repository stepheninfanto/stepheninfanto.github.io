          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Life </strong> Nikola Tesla was born as  an ethnic Serb in the 
                village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire 
                (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.

                One of the greatest inventors of all time, Nikola Tesla, “The genius who lit the world”, is well known for the Tesla coil (which laid the foundation for wireless technologies), the development of the alternating-current electrical system, while also being credited with the discovery of the rotating magnetic field.

However, such a project needed investors and, despite having found them, they eventually started to doubt his system. This led to bankruptcy and the tower he had built had to be sold in order to cover his debt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nikola Tesla was never the marrying type, as he thought that being in a relationship would interfere with his work. But since most of us need another soul to keep us company and understand us, Tesla had a very special relationship with his pigeons, going as far as

            <li>
                Tesla showed us that everything is possible when you try hard enough, his legacy lives on to this day, and we will be forever grateful to this beautiful mind.
